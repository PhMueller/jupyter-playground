    "Modern deep learning methods are very sensitive to many hyperparameters, and, due to the long training times of state-of-the-art models, vanilla Bayesian hyperparameter optimization is typically computationally infeasible. On the other hand, bandit-based configuration evaluation approaches based on random search lack guidance and do not converge to the best configurations as quickly. With HpBanster, we propose to combine the benefits of both Bayesian optimization and bandit-based methods, in order to achieve the best of both worlds: strong anytime performance and fast convergence to optimal configurations. We propose a new practical state-of-the-art hyperparameter optimization method, which consistently outperforms both Bayesian optimization and Hyperband on a wide range of problem types, including high-dimensional toy functions, support vector machines, feed-forward neural networks, Bayesian neural networks, deep reinforcement learning, and convolutional neural networks. Our method is robust and versatile, while at the same time being conceptually simple and easy to implement.\n",

The resulting figures and interactive plots can be used to gain insights in the parameter importance, feature importance, search behaviour and quality. For a detailed report on the various analysis methods that CAVE offers, please see the documentation.\n",
    "For HpBandSter/BOHB CAVE offers a report that can be used to compare the optimization process over the individual budgets. Each analysis method is performed for each individual budget.\n"
